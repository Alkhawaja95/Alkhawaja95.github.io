    "text": "Welcome to my website!\nI am a PhD candidate in the Bioinformatics & Computational Biology (BCB) curriculum at UNC Chapel Hill and a member of the Mohlke lab. My research focuses on understanding the genetics of complex diseases. I use single cell genomics to study regulation of genes affecting cardiometabolic disease. I am also involved in science outreach. I participated in teaching coding in the “How to Learn to Code” summer miniseries at UNC. In my free time, I like to read, cook, and watch movies.\nBefore joining UNC, I obtained my B.Sc in Biomedical Science - molecular and cell biology from Zewail City in Egypt. I was further interested in combining my experimental skills with data analysis, and completing my graduate diploma in Bioinformatics from Nile University paved the way to join the BCB PhD program at UNC.\nOn this website, you will find a selection of my ongoing projects. You will also find information on upcoming events and conferences where I will be speaking. I invite you to explore my website and learn more about my life’s work. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects."
